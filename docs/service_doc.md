# The idea of the application
- the idea is all about sharing software informations and learning resources with other developers, in linkedin or facebook or any other social media service, people in our network are the most commonly users who will see our posts and contributions, but this app is different becasue anyone who interested in any topic can search by the topic and can see your thread without being in your network.
# The Supported Features
- user can sign-up, sign-in or sign-out.
- user can list all the threads.
- user can create a new thread.
- user can add a like or comment to any thread (even his threads).
- user can sort threads by number of likes (more likes more common thread).
- user can view all comments of any thread.
- user can delete his/her like/comment from any thread he/she has liked/commented before, but user can't delete any other user's like/comment.
- user can delete his/her own threads only.
- a thread can be tagged by one or more tags so it will be easier to be found by other users later.
